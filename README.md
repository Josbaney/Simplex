# Simplex
Simple Programming Language. Inspired by Lisp.

# Introduction 

Simplex is my trial to re-invent lisp, as a developer who came from the background of OOP and Procedural Programming. <br/>
The language is turing complete, with many features and a light-weight core. 

More detailed documentation and tutorials will be added soon.

# Status
