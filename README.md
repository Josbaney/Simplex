# Simplex
Simple Programming Language. Inspired by Lisp.

## Introduction 


### Brief Intro

Simplex is a Lisp-based programming language (lisp-diaclet or lisp-variant), built for experimentation and educational purposes as a side project, it was meant to be different from the mainstream languages with some amazing features borrowed from many languages.<br/>

The motivation behind it was to push my limits in programming and in **C** especially, also as a part of my learning process to explore computer science and as a personal challenge.

- More detailed documentation and tutorials will be added soon.
- Binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac will be available soon.

### What's simplex ?

Simplex is simple programming language. Inspired by Lisp, Python, Fortran and BASIC.<br/>
It was built mainly following the book [Build Your Own Lisp](www.buildyourownlisp.com).<br/><br/>
With many improvements and modifications, it's my trial to re-invent Lisp.
