# Simplex
Simple Programming Language. Inspired by Lisp.

# Introduction 

Simplex is my trial to re-invent lisp, as a developer who came from the background of OOP and Procedural Programming. <br/>
The language is Turing-complete, with many features and a light-weight core. 

More detailed documentation and tutorials will be added soon.

# Basic Tutorial

Printing :<br/>
(print "Hello World")
<br/><br/>
Input :<br/>
(scan "X)
<br/><br/>
Arithmetic  :<br/> 
(+ 3 4 5 6 7)  == 25<br/>
(- 3 2) ==  1<br/>
(\* 3 4) == 12<br/>
(/ 12 6) == 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
Variables :<br/>
(define [a] 100)
<br/><br/>
Lists :<br/>
(define [w] [1 2 3 4 5 6])
<br/><br/>
Functions :<br/>
(fun [add x y] [+ x y])
<br/><br/>
